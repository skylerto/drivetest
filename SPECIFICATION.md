# Drive Test

Because I love markdown, git, and github, here are a few notes on taking an Ontario Drive Test.

Keep in mind before doing the test that you are attempting to show your
instructor that you are capable of defensive driving, always do the safe thing,
check your mirrors and blind spots, pay attention to road signs, school zones,
give right of way, ensure pedestrians crossing always reach their destination before
executing a turn. Stop *before* the white line, two hands on the wheel at all times,
use indicator when parking.

The topics I will go over in this document include:
  - Preparations
  - Driving:
    - 2 point turn
    - 3 point turn
    - Making a left turn
    - Marking a right turn
    - Switching lanes
  - Stopping:
    - Stop sign
    - Stop light
    - Emergency stop
  - Parking:
    - Uphill park
    - Downhill park
    - Forward park
    - Reverse park
    - Parallel park

## Preparations

Make sure you know the vehicle you are driving. You should know at least how to turn
on/use your headlights on, high beams on, wipers on, emergency break, four ways,
signal light, AC/Heat, how to adjust your mirrors, seat, seatbelt.

## Driving

During the driving test, make sure you are always staying aware of what is
around you. You should be checking your mirrors, over both shoulders, and
scanning for any cars, road signs, or pedestrians.

You should also pay attention to your speed. It is important that you **do not
exceed the speed limit** stay within `-5` of the speed. You should also know
that unless otherwise posted the speed is *50km/hr*.

If there are 2 lanes, drive in the right. If there are 3 or more, drive in the
lane directly to the left of the right most lane.

### 2 Point Turn

When executing a 2 point turn, make sure you use your indicator, check mirrors
and blind spots before slowing down, enter/pull into where you are making the 2 point turn.

Put the car in reverse, use your indicator to show which direction you are backing
out, check mirrors and blind spots, and reverse out.

Check all mirrors and blind spots, put the car in drive and drive away.

### 3 Point Turn

When executing a 3 point turn, indicator you are pulling off to the side, check
your mirrors and blind spots, apply the breaks to a complete stop.

Check mirrors and blind spots, indicate a left turn, check both ways, turn as fully as
possible.

Put the car in reverse, indicate a right backup, check mirrors blind spots
and both ways, reverse as far as possible.

Indicate a left turn, check mirrors blind spots and both ways, continue on your way.

### Left turn

When making a left turn, turn the left indicator on. Check your mirrors and
blind spots, make sure there are **no** pedestrians in the walk way and no cars,
before entering the intersection with straight wheels, do not turn your vehicle.
After ensuring that the way *is* without a doubt safe, check right, left, and
right again only then, execute the left turn.

### Right turn

When making a right turn, turn the right indicator on. Check all mirrors and
blind spots, slow down. If there is a stop sign, follow those procedures, if
there is a red light, treat it as a stop sign. Ensure there are no pedestrians
and/or vehicles in the intersection. Only when it is safe to do so, look left,
right, then left again, only then execute the right turn.

### Switching Lanes

When switching lanes it is important to remember the order of operations. First,
signal in the direction you would like to move. Next, check your rear view
mirror, then the mirror in the direction you are moving, then your blind spot,
finally execute the lane switch. Turn off the indicator.

## Stopping

**Always** check your rear view mirror before slowing down/stopping. Make sure you
**always** stop before the white line, making sure you can see a little bit of
the line.

If there are vehicle in front of you, make sure you stop behind the vehicle
making sure you can see their tires and a little pavement.

### Stop Sign

When approaching a stop sign, check the rear view mirror, indicate the direction
you would like to go (or none) then apply the breaks stopping before the white
line. Stop for 3 seconds, scan the area, making sure there are no pedestrians,
cars, or any other vehicles in the intersection. Only when it is safe to do so,
proceed.

If you cannot see on either side of the road way, make sure you follow the
stopping protocol, then enter slowly into the intersection checking left, right,
and forward.

### Stop Light

At a stop light, follow the same protocol as a stop sign. Remembering to scan
the area LRPC (left,right,pedestrian,cars).

### Emergency Stop

When executing an emergency stop, safely move into the right most lane. Turn the
right indicator on checking all mirrors and blind spots, apply the breaks. When
a stop has been reached, turn on the 4 ways, put the car in park, and engage the
parking break.

To come out, disengage the parking break, put the car in drive, remove 4 ways,
turn on indicator, check all mirrors and blind spots. Enter roadway when it is
safe to do so.

## Parking

When marking make sure to use your indicator and check your mirrors
and blind spots consistently. Watch out for pedestrians and passing cars.

When parking, spacing is key. If you are parking near a curb make sure you are
no more than 30 cm (12 inches) away from the curb. Also, for each type of
parking remember they key spots.

### Uphill Park

When parking up hill it is important to determine if there is a curb in your
location of not.

#### Without a Curb

When parking up hill indicate to the right, check mirrors and blind spots before
slowing down, pull off to the side of the road. Making sure you are straight, and
30 cm away from the shoulder.

Turn the wheels all the way to the right. Put the car in park. Finally, engage the
parking break.

When exiting a park, disengage the parking break, put the car in drive. Indicate
you are pulling onto the road way, check all mirrors and blind spots, then again
over the left should before entering the roadway.

#### With a Curb

When parking uphill with a curb, the only difference is to turn the wheels to
the left instead of to the right.

When exiting a park, disengage the parking break, put the car in drive. Indicate
you are pulling onto the road way, check all mirrors and blind spots, then again
over the left should before entering the roadway.

### Downhill Park

When parking down hill indicate to the right, check mirrors and blind spots before
slowing down, pull off to the side of the road. Making sure you are straight, and
30 cm away from the shoulder.

Turn the wheels all the way to the right. Put the car in park. Finally, engage the
parking break.

When exiting a park, disengage the parking break, put the car in drive. Indicate
you are pulling onto the road way, check all mirrors and blind spots, then again
over the left should before entering the roadway.


### Forward Park

When executing a forward park, stay to the right of the lane way (approx 3 feet). Turn your left
indicator on, checking all mirrors and blind spots. Line up your mirror with the
outside of the first car. Turn the wheel all the way to the left, slowly
straightening the wheel as you pull into the parking space. When you are
parallel with the cars beside you, or the parking space, pull straight in.

When reversing out, put the car in reverse make sure to indicate the direction
you would like to go, check mirrors and blind spots, when it's safe slowly start
exiting the space, consistently checking mirrors and blind spots.

### Reverse Park

Indicate to the right/left, check mirrors and blind spots pass the spot, checking
mirrors and blind spot before stopping. Leaving a little room between you are the
cars next to you. Line up your mirror with the far side of the second parking
space. Turn the wheel all the way, checking mirrors and blind spots before
reversing, reverse into the parking space, when you are lined up straight, turn
the wheel straight and reverse back into the space.

When leaving the parking space, put the car in drive, indicate the direction you
would like to go, check mirrors and blind spots and slowly exit the space. Be
aware of any vehicles and/or pedestrians.

### Parallel Park

When parallel parking, make sure to indicate to the right, check all mirrors and
blind spots before slowing down.
Stop beside the space you would like to enter to make sure you have enough room.
Check mirrors and blind spot before pulling up.
Pull up so your front seats and the other cars front seats are even, put the car
in reverse. Make sure the indicator is still on (right).
Check mirrors and blind spots before reversing, turn the wheel all the way to
the right.
Once your middle bar is inline with their bumper, reverse straight back.
Once your mirror passes their back bumper turn the wheel all the way to the
left and continue backing up.
Readjust to ensure you are within 30 cm (12 inches) from the curb.


## Order of Operations

Pedestrians, cars, empty lane way.
Check mirrors and blind spots every 5 seconds.
Indicate before checking mirrors and blind spots.
Check, execute turn.
