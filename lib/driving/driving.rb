      INFO = "During the driving test, make sure you are always staying aware of what is around you. You should be checking your mirrors, over both shoulders, and
scanning for any cars, road signs, or pedestrians.

You should also pay attention to your speed. It is important that you **do not
exceed the speed limit** stay within `-5` of the speed. You should also know
that unless otherwise posted the speed is *50km/hr*.

If there are 2 lanes, drive in the right. If there are 3 or more, drive in the
lane directly to the left of the right most lane."
